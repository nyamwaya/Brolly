The Flood Watch continues for * All of southern New England * From Friday morning through Saturday afternoon * Heavy rain is expected to overspread the region from west to east Friday afternoon and evening continuing at times into Saturday morning. This combined with rapid snow melt will result in the possibility of some river and stream flooding along with the potential for isolated ice jam flooding. * The heavy rainfall combined with snow clogged storm drains may also result in the potential for significant urban/street flooding. This has the potential to impact the Friday evening commute. * Storm total rainfall amounts of 1.5 to 3 inches with locally up to 4 inches are forecast over the entire region.
